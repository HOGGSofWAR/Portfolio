In this project I turned what was more of a print design than a web design into code. I used HTML, PHP, Javascript, VueJS and SCSS. Woocommerce was used for the E-commerce side of the site. This website had some of the most challenging scss I have experienced, with lots of pseudo water droplet elements and background elements in different variations across different pages. VueJS was used for the blog feed and the filters. Filters were based on custom post types after originally being requested to be built using categories - this mean a huge rebuild of all feed sections and even some carousel blocks in just a couple of days. Whilst I wish the project could have been smoother from a project planning and communication perspective it is one of my proudest pieces of work.',
